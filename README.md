In modern JS one can use a lot of techniques of functional programming. One such technique to build an execution chain are monads. We will discuss what they are, what basic types are common and take a quick look into the specifications to find out what makes a monad. We will discuss how they can be applied alongside objects and when they might come in handy. We will see how monads can be used in action by means of an example. Lastly we will discover where JS already utilizes monadic structures.
